        "question": "What is process and function outsourcing?",
        "answer": "It is a form of cooperation in which we take over a specific, separated part of tasks, functions, or processes performed by your company and carry them out using our employees. Our employees perform the functions and activities specified in the contract in your company for the period specified in the agreement. It is worth noting that in this form of cooperation, you do not have any legal relationship with our employee, meaning you cannot dismiss the employee but can ask us for a replacement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does process and function outsourcing mean in practice?",
        "answer": "In practice, we take full responsibility for HR (candidate selection, interviews, conducting examinations, training, and employment), payroll (contributions, funds, insurance, and payments to the employee), employee management, and the tasks entrusted to our company (introducing the employee to the workplace, training, and acclimatization). You only receive an invoice at the end of the month."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to recruit and place an employee?",
        "answer": "If we do not have an employee suitable for the specified position in our resources, we start the recruitment process to find a suitable candidate. This process can take, depending on the employee's qualifications, from 2 weeks (unqualified person) to a month for a specific specialist. Procedures such as obtaining information from the local labor market office, necessary for employing a foreign worker, and obtaining a work permit, which is required for a work visa, usually take about 2 months. The waiting time for a visa can vary and depends on many factors, such as geopolitical situation, employee qualifications, or the number of non-candidates applying for a visa at the same consulate.<br /><br /> It is also worth mentioning that Polish embassies often use a term lottery system, which can add uncertainty to the date when the candidate can submit their visa documents. Therefore, we periodically update information on the time needed to obtain terms at specific embassies in each country. You can find this information below on our website (or, if you are subscribed to our newsletter, you will receive it by email first).<br /><br /> 1. Philippines - up to 2 months to obtain a visa (accreditation takes place within 2 weeks) <br /><br />2. Vietnam - from 3 to 7 months <br /><br />3. Uzbekistan - waiting period 3-7 months. <br /><br />4. Kyrgyzstan - waiting period up to 2-2.5 months <br /><br />5. Turkey waiting period 3-5 months <br /><br />6. Kenya - waiting period 3-7 months <br /><br />7. India and Nepal waiting period 3-8 months <br /><br />8. Belarus and Georgia waiting period approx. 2-3 months"

      {
        "question": "What are the costs of employment and recruitment?",
        "answer": "Depending on the order, the number of people and their qualifications, the total cost is always discussed individually with the client. We always provide preliminary costs after receiving the client's order guidelines in the preliminary and non-binding order form sent by email or filled out on the holdhand.work website."
      },
      {
        "question": "If I provide accommodation for employees, is it deducted from the final amount in the settlements?",
        "answer": "Yes, this is taken into account when cooperating with us. You issue us an invoice every month, or during negotiations, we include this fact in our calculations, which affects the final price and is directly reflected in the invoice issued by us. We are also open to other proposals from your side."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are settlements made?",
        "answer": "At the end of the month, based on the calculation of the number of hours worked by the employees, we issue you an invoice for the services provided by our employees.<br /> <br />The hourly rate established through negotiations is calculated based on the number of hours worked by all employees performing work in your company, plus VAT."
      },
      {
        "question": "From which country in our offer can you get an employee to work the fastest?",
        "answer": "The fastest way to hire an employee is through the Statement on the entrustment of work to a foreigner. Generally speaking, it applies to citizens of 5 countries: Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. (Although after the invasion by Russia, Ukraine received a special type of procedure called 'Notification of entrustment of work to a Ukrainian citizen', which further speeds up the possibility of hiring a foreign worker). The statement is usually issued within 7 days of submission.<br /><br /> After obtaining the statement, the only thing left is to issue a visa for the candidate, which takes about a month in these countries. The advantage of this option is the lack of need to obtain information from the local labor market office and no need to obtain a work permit.<br /><br />  This option has its limitations:<br /> <br /> - If you care about long-term cooperation, i.e., over 2 years, the person employed based on the statement can only work for exactly 2 years. In such a case, we extend the employee's stay.<br /> - If you care about hiring a person for seasonal work, this is not possible, as a permit is needed for such work.<br /> - At the moment, from the above-mentioned countries, we have in our offer: Belarus, Georgia, and Moldova. Over time, however, we will supplement our offer with other countries."
      },
      {
        "question": "If it turns out that the employee is not fulfilling their obligations, is there a way out of this situation?",
        "answer": "We provide the possibility of replacing the employee in cases where they are not fulfilling the obligations resulting from the contract or show gross negligence, carelessness, or other omissions that directly affect the functioning of your company. This applies only to the process and function outsourcing and body leasing services."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there an option for direct employment of the employee?",
        "answer": "In our offer, apart from outsourcing, temporary work, and body leasing, we also have a recruitment option that we conduct based on the guidelines received from you in the order form. It is directly based on finding a candidate, conducting interviews, issuing the necessary documents, and bringing the selected candidate directly to your company. <br /><br /> The amount for such recruitment is determined individually, assuming that: A qualified candidate - through negotiations, depending on the candidate's specialization and education. An unqualified candidate - approx. 900 PLN + recruitment costs, document issuance, and transportation to Poland. <br /><br /> Settlement for the service takes place after bringing the employee to your company (e.g., after a one-month probationary period). <br /><br /> If you are interested in being present during interviews or any other recruitment process, we are open to this possibility."
